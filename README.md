# eleith's dot files

these [dot files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory)
are a collection of configuration files i use to customize my terminal experience

i use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage them in a private
self-hosted git repository managed by [gitea](https://gitea.io)

a self-hosted [woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) instance watches for
changes to my dotfiles, extract thems, and commits them to this repo where
i can quickly reference and share them

## tools

i use [fish](https://fishshell.com/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki),
[nvim](https://neovim.io/) and [gnome-terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal)
as my top level terminal tools

## colorscheme

exclusively [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) in the past, then
switched to [gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox) for various
reasons
