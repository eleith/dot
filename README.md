# eleith's dot files

these
[dot files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) are
a collection of configuration files i use to customize my terminal experience

i use [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) to manage them in a private self-hosted
git repository managed by [gitea](https://gitea.io)

a self-hosted [woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org/) instance monitors for
changes to my dotfiles. some of those changes are then extracted and commited to
this repo where i can quickly reference and share as needed

## tools

i use [fish](https://fishshell.com/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki),
[nvim](https://neovim.io/) and [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/)

## colorscheme

i've mostly used [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) in the
past, however, i'm currently using
[gruvbox](https://github.com/gruvbox-community/gruvbox)
